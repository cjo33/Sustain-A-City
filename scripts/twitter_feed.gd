# Loop through: Pollution, Yearly_Pollution, Electricity, Happiness, Income

# Pollution
# When Pollution changes from positive to negative
# When Pollution is 50% of threshold value
# When Pollution is over the threshold and Years_Over

# Yearly_Pollution
# When its + 50 (negative message) 
# When its + 200 (Strong negative)
# When its - 50 (positive)
# When its - 200 (strong positive)

# Electricity
# When you are generating excess, over 160% (neon green)
# When you are generating more than you need, over 100% (green)
# When you are generating not quite enough, 20-60% (Orange)
# When you are generating barely anything, 0-20% (Red)
# Electricity is at 70%, businesses are only recieving 70% of their profits

# Happiness
# 100% Green
# 60% Orange
# 30% Red
# Happiness has decreased to 80%, residents will only tollorate 800 kgCO2

# Income
# If income drops 30% on previous year display negative
# Display messages at year 10, 25, 50, 75, 100
# If after year 50, income is below 70 display negative
# if after year 50, income is above 150 display positive

######################## Extra More Specific Tile Messages ########################
# If build certain tile
# Display a message about some variable on that tile
# If its a park, it could either show, residents are more happy with their new park,
# or residents are worried about maintainance of their park

# Iterate through current tiles, check for those in disrepair, current values are 20% of what
# the initial value was, display a message about that tile

# If Electricity increases by more than 50% at any time, display positive message
	# at 30%, they then build a power station, electricity is at 80%, display a message saying
	# residents are now happy that there is enough power
# If Electricity decreases by more than 60% at any time, display negative message
